Sinus wave experiment, where the values are randomly sampled along each quadrant.

# Process

1) **setup.py** to create the data
2) **learn.py** to learn the models for RTI+ and RAI
3) **evaluate.py** to evaluate the models

Take a look to the **meta.py** because it contains all the variables and the parameters (you may modify some o them to make the process work)
