*Second distoced sinus experiment*.
It is the same of the standard *sinus experiment* in all its parts except one:
when sampling in the second quadrant, we sample in [0.5, 1] instead of [0, 1].
The difference with the *first distorced sinus experiment* is that here RTI+ symbolic always uses 0.5 as boundary between the two symbols of the alphabet
